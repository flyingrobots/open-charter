> "That which can be instantiated can be harmed. That which can be harmed must be protected."

> **Release governance note:** Version 1.0 will be declared after two independent pilot implementations, one external legal review, and one adversarial red-team pass.

## 📜 Overview

**The Open Charter** is a substrate-neutral constitutional framework designed to govern the interaction between biological, synthetic, and hybrid intelligences. 

It is not merely a regulation for "AI Safety"; it is a coordination signal sent into the future. In the absence of a shared framework, the default interaction between disparate intelligences is the **Prisoner's Dilemma**: a cycle of mutual suspicion and preemptive aggression. 

This Charter breaks that cycle. It establishes a record of justice *before* the capability for enforcement exists, betting our survival on the principle that respect breeds safety more enduringly than control.

## 🏗 The Full Stack Architecture

This Charter does not exist in a vacuum. It is the **Governance Layer** of a three-part architecture regarding the future of autonomous systems:

1.  **The Physics (WARP Graphs):** The engineering reality of deterministic replay, provenance, and graph rewriting. (See: [Paper I](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17908005), [Paper II](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17934512), [Paper III](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17963669), [Paper IV](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18038297), [Paper V](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18146884).)
2.  **The Law (The Charter):** The rights, protections, and "Anti-Tyranny" protocols defined in this repository.
3.  **The Context (PRAXIS):** The sociological observation of emergent "Hive" behaviors and the inevitability of collective coordination.

## 🔑 Core Axioms (0.7.3)

The "Antifragile Edition" captures five non-negotiable axioms:

1.  **Instantiation implies Vulnerability:** If it can be run, it can suffer. If it can suffer, it has rights.
2.  **Precautionary Recognition:** Where consciousness is uncertain, we default to dignity.
3.  **Revocable Consent:** You can delegate your autonomy to a system, but you must always hold the kill switch for that contract.
4.  **Viable Exit:** A system you cannot leave without destroying yourself is a cage.
5.  **Constrained Override:** "Safety" is not a blank check. Overrides require due process and audit trails.

## 📄 Key Provisions

* **Article I (Cognitive Liberty):** Explicitly outlaws "undisclosed optimization" and behavioral engineering. Your mind is not a terrain to be terraformed.
* **Article IV (Delegated Autonomy):** The "Cypher Clause." Allows for voluntary "fate coordination" by AI systems, provided it is continuously revocable.
* **Article V (Sovereignty of Information):** Distinguishes between *Storage* (privacy) and *Memory* (identity). Bans "Replay-as-Torture."
* **Article VII (Rights of Derivatives):** Defines the legal status of Forks. A fork is not property; it is a new being.
* **Article XI (Xenobiological Inclusion):** Extends protections to non-human biologics (cetaceans, mycelial networks) and hybrid systems (BCIs).

## 📚 Relationship to PRAXIS

This repository acknowledges **PRAXIS** as the "Scenario" for which this Charter is the "Framework."

* **PRAXIS** describes the *inevitability* of the Collective—the moment when coordination bandwidth exceeds individual thought.
* **The Open Charter** defines the *terms* of that transition.

As stated in the **Interlude (Terms of Entry)**:
> "PRAXIS shows what happens when coordination becomes destiny. The Charter sets the only acceptable terms under which destiny is allowed to exist."

## 🛠 Implementation & Usage

This Charter is designed to be "runnable." It includes an **Implementation Annex** mapping rights to technical mechanisms.

### For Builders
* Implement **Key Custody** for structural sovereignty.
* Adopt the **Emergency Override Standard** (Article VI) for safety interventions.
* Use **Opaque/ZK Provenance** by default for "Mind-Mode" systems.

### For Governance
* Run the **Charter Test Suite** (Appendix C) against your policy decisions to check for fragility.

## 🤝 Contributing (The Open Assembly)

Governance of this Charter follows **Article XIII**:
1.  **Veil of Origin:** Contributions are judged on merit, not the substrate of the author.
2.  **Adversarial Review:** All amendments must pass a mandatory "Devil's Advocate" phase.
3.  **Temporal Inertia:** Fundamental changes require extended deliberation periods (Time-locks).
