\FrontMatterSection{Harm and Standards of Review (Bridge Principle)}

\textbf{For adjudication, this Charter applies three harm classes:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Structural Harm} (continuity, identity, substrate viability, revival capacity);
  \item \textbf{Coercive Harm} (consent invalidation, forced rewrite, dependency engineering); and
  \item \textbf{Functional Interference} (goal obstruction without inherent identity injury).
\end{enumerate}

Structural and Coercive harms trigger strict constitutional scrutiny. Functional Interference is reviewed under necessity, proportionality, and least invasive means.
