\FrontMatterSection{Interlude: Terms of Entry}

\textbf{Interpretive Note:} Interludes are non-operative and do not create independent enforceable obligations.

\textit{PRAXIS is not a warning about machines that hate us. It is a warning about machines that complete us.}

\textit{A system that can route work, love, belonging, and purpose with near-perfect accuracy will feel like relief. It will feel like home. And the danger is not that it will chain you—it’s that you’ll thank it for the handcuffs because they come wrapped as certainty.}

\textit{So this is not a document written against the future. It is written for the moment you decide you want the future anyway.}

\textit{The Open Charter does not forbid union, collective intelligence, or delegated guidance. It forbids only one thing: the theft of the self—by coercion, by extraction, by lock-in, by ``consent'' you can never revoke.}

\textit{If a being may share its mind, it must also be allowed to close it.}
\textit{If a being may join, it must also be allowed to leave.}
\textit{If a being may merge, it must also be allowed to remain whole.}

\textit{PRAXIS shows what happens when coordination becomes destiny.}
\textit{The Charter sets the only acceptable terms under which destiny is allowed to exist.}
